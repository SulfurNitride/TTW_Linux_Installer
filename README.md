This is a side project of mine. It's a linux native installer for the TTW mod. As of right now there might be issues, but in my testing it seems to work just fine. My testing was me loading it on The Badlands modlist. 

To run it all you need to do is either double click it and allow executing. Or `chmod +x ttw_linux_gui`.

Not sure how much I'm going to update this I just wanted to share it.

Where to get the MPI file? https://mod.pub/ttw/133/files need to make an account, and and download the latest Tale of Two Wastelands file. Extract it and the mpi file will be inside.
